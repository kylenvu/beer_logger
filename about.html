    <h1>About Beer Logger</h1>
  </header>
  <p>BeerLogger aims to provide a simple way of logging your beer experiences! Our hope is that everyone (21+)
     can elevate their beer drinking experiences by using BeerLogger. By logging beers, beer lovers as well as
    those who don’t normally reach for a beer, can keep track of what they do or do not enjoy. Ultimately, this
    allows for growth in self awareness of personal preferences when it comes to beer selection. It also provides
    an added element of fun by fostering knowledge about different types of beers and popular brewers. This crates
    a fun environment in which one can responsibly share their beer experiences with friends, colleagues, or new
    acquaintances! Thank you for choosing BeerLogger, we ask that you please drink responsibly, happy logging!</p>
